# 3D-Gaussian-Distribution-Visualization-using-Python
 This Python project visualizes a 3D Gaussian distribution using matplotlib and numpy. It creates a 3D surface plot representing the distribution's bell curve in two dimensions, showcasing probability density and symmetry. Ideal for understanding Gaussian behavior in a multi-dimensional space.
